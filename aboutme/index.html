    <p>Hey everyone my name is Andrew Riley. I am excited to be here and get to know all of you!
        <p>Here is a little bit about myself. I originally was born in California but then moved to Utah when I was 6 years old. I have lived here the remainder of my life.</p>
        <p>I decided to serve a two year mission and was called to Dallas Texas Spanish speaking which was the time of my life. I have recently returned about a year ago. Over the past year I have worked various jobs of construction at a copper mine which was a ton of fun. Now I am looking forward to go back to my original passion in highschool which was programing.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing the BS applied technology and trying to finish by the fall of 2025. I am excited to learn these skills for two reasons. One, it has always been a pasion of mine and second, I know that it will bring a secure job and income for me and my future family.</p>
        <p>In the picture above is, from right to left, my dad, David, my mom, Krista, my sister, Mikale, and finally me.</p>
