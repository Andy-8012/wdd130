                <p class="answer_par">In it's simplest form day trading is 
                    looking at a certain market whether it be the regular 
                    stock market or foreign exchange market and quickly 
                    making decision whether the price will go up or go down.
                    Most day traders will spend anywhere from 2-5 hours in 
                    front of their computers taking trades. Those trades will 
                    usually last for only a couple minutes to a full day at most.
                    Day trading is another way you can make a secondary source of 
                    income however it can be very risky. Trade at your own risk

                <h1 class="question_header">Can you make a full time income with Day Trading?</h1>
                <img class = "answer_img" src="images/answer_icon.png" alt="(Answer Picture)">
                <p class="answer_par">You certainly can! Day traders can make 
                    anwhere from zero dollars to thousands every single day. 
                    What you have to remember is risk managment. This is a common 
                    practiced used by traders to make sure that they maintain 
                    a certain ammount of money in their account so they can 
                    continue making money. Another way to look at it is percentages. 
                    Some day trades are making 0% to all the way up to 1000% a year. 
                    If you were to have $20,000 and you make 200% in a single year. You 
                    Would have made $40,000 that year. For some that is a full time 
                    income. The more money you have the easier it is to make money.
                    However you do not need a ton to make a full time income and can 
                    quickly build up your capital over the years.

                <li>
                    <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="first">
                    <label for="first">How man hours a day do I have to sit in front of my computer?</label>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>That definitley depends. What I reccomend is only 1-2 hours a 
                            day. The reason is because the longer we sit there the more 
                            greed gets in our head. We want to be like robbots. Once we 
                            hit how much we wanted to make for the day we should get off.
                            Also the other way around if we lose a certain ammount of 
                            money we need to get off so we don't continue to lose. Trading 
                            1-2 hours a day usually allows you to easily get 2-3 trades in 
                            which is plenty to make a full time income.

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Not a ton. Many people fail at day trading. The reason usually is 
                            because they do not have the adequate training. Aswell as greed.
                            Many people lose a ton of money because of greed. If you want 
                            to be successful at day trading it is like anything. You must 
                            put in a lot of hours and work at it every single day. A lot of 
                            people don't do that.

                        <p>Now a days it is easier than ever. All you need is a stable 
                            internet connection and a smart phone or computer of some 
                            kind.

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>I do not have a personal favorite. However I would stay away form 
                            free indicators. Most of the time these indicators are using 
                            yesterday's data not the current live market. I would look into 
                            paid indicators that move according to the live market. Also, be 
                            cautious because there are so many out there you must do your 
                            research and test them thouroughly before you go live.
