                    <p>What is Technical Analysis?</p>
                    <p>Technical analysis is using candle stick patterns to 
                        determine if the price will continue upward or move 
                        downward. For many people this is the prefered method 
                        because it is very easy to do this for free.
                    </p>
                    <p>Advantages of Technical Analysis</p>
                    <p>The main advantage that comes from technical analysis is 
                        everyone has access to it. All you need is a charting 
                        software that tracks the price of the market. There are 
                        many free resources on line.
                    </p>
                    <p>Disadvantages of Technical Analysis</p>
                    <p>The main disadvantage to technical analysis is how many 
                        patterns there are. It take a long time to master each 
                        pattern that shows up sometimes thousands of hours.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="indicators-acc">
                <label for="indicators-acc">Indicators</label>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>What are Indicators?</p>
                    <p>There are two main types of indicators. First, lagging 
                        indicators which are usually free. Seccond, live indicators 
                        which are usually a paid service.
                    </p>
                    <p>Both types of indicators use an algorythm to predict which 
                        way the market is going to go. These aren't used as much 
                        because a lot of people beleive that since they are more 
                        commonly used they can be manipulated especailly lagging indicators 
                    </p>
                    <p>Advantages of Indicators</p>
                    <p>The main advantage from using indicators is they are easy for 
                        a beginer to read. All you are doing are looking at lines 
                        pointed up or down that tell you which way the market will move.
                    </p>
                    <p>Disadvantages of Indicators</p>
                    <p>The main disadvantage and concern for using indicators are 
                        there are so many out there how do you know which one to choose. 
                        Also with their easy readibility they can also be easily manipulated.
                        More expereinced traders could use these idicators to determine what 
                        beginners are thinking and do the opposite to make even more money.
