        Have you ever wanted to learn how to day trade but never knew where to start? Well you've come to the right place.
        The whole purpose of this website is to teach you the very basics of day trading. There will be two main parts of this website. The first part is the home page where you will be able to find all the basic information on what day trading is and how it can benefit you. The second part will be on the Learning page. On this page we will go over basic trading techniques you could possibly use.
        So day trading what is it?
        Day trading can be different for many people. The simplest way to explain it however is it is the ability to make money in the markets (Forex Market, Stock Market, or others) on a daily basis. Doing this can be very lucrative however if you don't know what you are doing some people say it is a form of gambling. However that is not the case. With basic knowledge of the markets we can predict what will happen next.
        Here we focus on the Forex market. The reason why we do this is because it is open 24 hours a day Monday-Thursaday unlike the Stock market which is only open form 9:30am EST to 2:30am EST Monday-Friday. This allows people who work full time jobs to also trade in the forex market to make an extra side income or even better another full time income.
        The Forex Market deals with currencies. Many of you would know it as the Foreign Exchange Market. In this market how we make money is by comparing the value of two different currencies like the Euro and the US Dollar. When one of these currencies go up in value that means the other currency has to go down. We deterimine which one is going to go up and place a trade in the currency saying it will go up. If it does go up we make money if it doesn't That is when we lose money.
        Now remember these are just the very basics of trading there are a lot more things that go into trading but we will most likely not cover them all. The purpose of this website is to show you the basics and get your foot in the door where you can possibly use to determine if you want to learn more.

      <h3>Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Let's learn how to day trade.
        There are many different styles people like to use to day trade. Some people have created their own indicators that tell them whether the market will go up or down based on an algorithm. Or what many people prefer to use is what is called technical analysis.
        Lets talk about the indicators first.
        There are free indicators that a lot of people use however since they are free you can already assume they will not give you the best advantage. Now it is not terrible to use these indicators it is just not the prefered method.
        There are many companies who sell their indicators and algorithms for you to use that actually do work as long as you know how to read them correctly. These is a very lucritve business for people who have these algorithms because they can use their indicators to make money and have people pay them to learn how to use their indicators in a coaching program. Many people do this.
        Now lets go to the most perfered method. Technical analysis.
        So why is Technical analysis the most prefered? This is because if read correctly it usually pays off pretty well. However not everyone knows how to do this. Technical analysis is in the simplist form patterns the form in the candle sticks of the chart. Depending on the pattern will determine whether it will continue moving upward or flip and go the opposite dirrection. Here are some videos you can use to learn more on technical analysis as well as images of chart patterns.
